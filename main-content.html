    <p>Are you tired of downloading massive minified javascripts that you have no idea what they do? With dependency injection and shit you don't even know what it means?</p>
    <p>Do you want to write clean html/css/js for people with proper browsers but at the same time use modules to keep your code neat? Look no further!</p>

    <h3 class="header-level-3"><a href="#header-1"></a>Exactly what the fuck are you talking about?</h3>

    <p>This very codeblock resides in a file called main-content.html. It's included like so:</p>

    <div class="language-js highlighter-rouge">
        <pre class="highlight">
        <code>
<span class="kd">&lt;script&gt;</span>
  <span class="nx">render</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">'main-content.html', document.currentScript</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</code>
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>The render function takes two parameters, the url to the module, a html file, and the reference to the current script block. The latter is required for the module loader to correctly replace the script block with the loaded module.</p>

    <p>The file <em>main-content.html</em> contains <strong>two</strong> tags: a html element tag and a script tag. They must be written in that exact order. The script tag then needs to call the automagically accessible done() function, to tell the module
        loader that it's finished initializing.</p>

    <div class="language-js highlighter-rouge">
        <pre class="highlight">
            <code>
    <span class="kd">&lt;div&gt;</span>
      <span class="nx">Content goes here.</span>
    <span class="kd">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    </code>
    <span class="kd">&lt;script&gt;</span>
      <span class="nx">// element, context and done are accessible through the module loader.</span>
      <span class="nx">element.innertHTML = `Element's a reference to the codeblock above!`;</span>
      <span class="nx">context.ihazmodules = true;</span>
      <span class="nx">done</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="kd">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
    </code>
    </pre>
    </div>


    <p>When all modules are loaded (has called their done functions) the module loader will call a function called bootstrap, if defined, and pass in a variable called context. The context variable is also accessible from within the modules. Either use that
        to pass data, or do it globally. I don't give a fuck.</p>

    <h3>What is the module loader?</h3>
    <p>If you've read this far you've probably already checked the source. Right?</p>
    <p>Did I mention it's 601 bytes huge when minified? (370 when gzipped)</p>

    <h3 class="header-level-3"><a href="#header-2"></a>You're doing too many requests asshole!</h3>
    <p>Use server push and stop whining!</p>
